Hello! I'm Ali RÄ±za AynacÄ±, a student passionate about software development. Currently, during my education, I'm gaining experience in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, with a particular interest in web development and backend projects.

I'm working on improving my skills in Spring Boot and other backend technologies, striving to acquire in-depth knowledge in this field. When faced with challenges during project work, I prefer to think solution-oriented. I analyze problems, evaluate different solution options, and collaborate with teammates to find the most suitable solution.

Teamwork is crucial to me because working harmoniously as a team enhances the success of projects. Trust, communication, and solidarity among team members lay the foundation for successful projects.

To continually develop myself, I utilize various resources. I closely follow documentation and online sources to stay updated on the latest developments and updates in technologies. Additionally, I practice on projects and participate in various programming events to enhance my skills.
